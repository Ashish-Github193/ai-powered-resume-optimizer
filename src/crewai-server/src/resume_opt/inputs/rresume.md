## Profeshunal Summery  
I’m a software dude with like 5 years doing stuff with computers and junk. I’m super good at bossing people around and fixing things when they break. I talk to people okay and make sure no one gets mad. I love making cool apps but sometimes they crash lol. I watch stuff to make sure it don’t mess up too bad.
